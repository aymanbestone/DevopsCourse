systemctl in Linux 
==================

--> It is a command-line utility in Linux to manage system services

Some common tasks that systemctl can perform are 
starting service
stoping service
restarting service
enabling /disabling services

examples: 
	sudo systemctl enable jenkins
	sudo systemctl start Jenkins

	Verify Jenkins

	sudo systemctl status Jenkins

Retarted the sshd service --> sudo systemctl restart sshd

systemctl start service-name --> start a service
systemctl stop service-name --> stops a service
systemctl restart service-name --> restarts service
systemctl reload service-name ==> reloads configuration files for a service without stopping it
systemctl enable service-name -> enables a service to start automatically at boot time
systemctl disable service-name -> disables a service from starting automatically at boot time
systemctl status service --> shows the current status of a service
systemctl list-units --type=service -> list all active services

=====================
Linux is CLI based free and open source OS which is secured.
--> It's a multi user  based OS
--> Highly recommended for project related to servers ( docker, Jenkins ,k8s, nexus, SonarQube ,websevers..)

Hardware 
Kernel 
shell

Whenever we execute any Linux commands shell will read our commands and it translates our command into kernel understandable formate

-->shell is a mediator between user and kernel 
Takes commands from the user (or scripts), interprets them, and passes them to the kernel for execution.

-->Kernel  will convert our commands into Linux hardware understandable format 
Manages: CPU scheduling, memory management, device drivers (talking directly to hardware), process management, and basic security.
