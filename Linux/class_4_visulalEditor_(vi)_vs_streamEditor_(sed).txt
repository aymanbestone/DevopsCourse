Text Editors in Linux 
-------------------

--> vi (visual editor)  --> it is a default editor in Linux machines

--> Using 'vi' we can create new files and we can modify existing file data

--> vi command is having 3 modes
   1) command mode ( we can just open file and navigate or see the content, we cannot edit or modify or add content in this mode)
    
    $ vi <filename> 
    
    $ vi devops.txt  ( if a file by the name devops is available thn it will open that existing file if not it will create a new file)


   2) insert mode ( to edit that file or to add the content into the file) press i in the keyboard to get into insert mode


   3) esc mode ( to come out of insert mode) press esc in keyboard 
     
      --> To Save the changes we have made in the file and close the file --> :wq
      --> To close the file without saving changes --> :q!

File Creation in Linux 
---------------------
touch --> To Create an empty file

cat --> To create file with data without opening any editor ( cat can be used to view and for copy too please refer to nodes above)

cp --> Copy one file data into another file ( cp aws.txt devops.txt)

vi --> create and open file for editing (vi f.txt)


Reading Data from a file
