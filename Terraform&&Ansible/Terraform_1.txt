Terraform ( IAC )
==================

What is Terraform?

Terraform is an infrastructure as code tool that lets you build, change, 
and version infrastructure safely and efficiently. 
( To create / provision infrastructure in cloud platform )

==> Develop  by HashiCorp

==> Supports all the popular cloud providers 

==> Terraform use HCL to code 
    HCL : HashiCorp Configuration Language

==> Terraform file we save with .tf extension

Create an EC2 instance on aws ( Amazon Linux )

Get connected to that Linux VM

sudo yum install -y yum-utils shadow-utils
sudo yum-config-manager --add-repo https://rpm.releases.hashicorp.com/AmazonLinux/hashicorp.repo
sudo yum -y install terraform

Verify if its installed 

terraform -v

=======================================
Terraform Architecture 
======================

--> Terraform uses HCL to code 

--> Terraform script must be saved with .tf extension

    ( refer diagram attached )

.tf --> terraform init --> terraform fmt --> terraform validate--> terraform plan --> terraform apply --> terraform destroy

terraform init --> To Initialize terraform script

terraform fmt --> Format terraform script ident spacing ( it will get script in proper order )

terraform validate --> Terraform script syntax will be verified ( validated )

terraform plan --> Creates Execution plan for terraform script

terraform apply --> Creates actual resources in cloud based on given plan

terraform destroy -->  It will destroy / delete the resource which got created in cloud


Terraform Documentation
========================

Terraform Registry
Discover Terraform providers that power all of Terraform's resource types, or find modules for quickly deploying common infrastructure configurations.
https://registry.terraform.io/browse/providers


==================================
Adding security credentials ( access key and security key )

--> If you're working in local windows machine add this in environtmental variables locally 

--> On Linux VM we can add 

export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID= "add your own key"
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY="add your own key"

First Terraform script 
========================

provider "aws" {
  region = "ap-south-1"
}
resource "aws_instance" "linux_vm" {

  ami             = "ami-0d54604676873b4ec"
  instance_type   = "t2.micro"
  key_name       = "terraform-kp"
  security_groups = ["default"]
  tags = {
    Name = "Telusko-Server"
  }
}
