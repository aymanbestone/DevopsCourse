==================

Why Auto Scaling?
====================

During events like Big Billion Day Sale, traffic is unpredictable.

You can't manually scale fast enough.

Auto Scaling helps by:
======================

Increasing instances when traffic goes up

Decreasing instances when traffic goes down

✅ Benefits of Auto Scaling:
==================================
Fault Tolerance

If an instance fails, another is launched automatically.

Cost Management

Only run the number of servers needed, saving money during low traffic.

High Availability

Keeps your application running smoothly under heavy load.
