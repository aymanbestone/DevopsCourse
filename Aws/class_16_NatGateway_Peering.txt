Procedure to connect EC2 vm of public subnet to EC2 VM of private subnet
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
-> upload pem file into public sn ec2 vm
-> after uploading provide permission to access pem file
$ chmod 400 <pem file >
-> make ssh connection from public sn ec2 vm to private sn ec2 vm 
$ ssh -i "pem-filename" ec2-user@private-ip

-> After getting connected to private sn ec2 vm try to ping www.google.com , you will not be able to ping or connect as outgoing traffic is not allowed

NAT Gateway must be used in order to allow internet outgoing traffic from private sn machine

VPC with NAT Gateway practicals
===============================
Create a NAT gateway in public subnet

Add NAT gateway in private  subnet route table

After adding NAT gatewat to private sn route table we could able to see that from ec2 vm of private subnet we could able to aceess the internet outgoing traffic 

Note : To Avoid bills delete NAT gaetway and elastic ip after practice

VPC Peering to enable communication between two VPCs ( it could be same account or diff account )
=====================================================
( Refer to live class recordings  and board work )
--> left navigation panel under vpc --> Peering Connections

VPC ( Requester ) --> telusko-vpc
VPC ( ACcepter ) --> default - vpc

==> Now you would see this status pending acceptance
==> Go to VPC Peering --> Click on Actions --> Accept Request
==> Make enteries in Route Tables
==> Navgate to Route Tables , edit routes in default vpc rt
( local + all tarffic with IGW + telusko-vpc ip range)
==> Navigate to route table of telusko-vpc and edit the routes
( local + all tarffic with IGW + telusko-vpc ip range)

==> Edit the security groups of VMs in both default vpc and telusko-vpc
SSH - 22 - all
All Traffic

Security Groups
==================
--> Acts like a firewall to secure our resources
--> Security group contans inbound rules ( incoming traffic ) and outbound rules ( outgoing traffic )
--> One SG we can add 50 rules
--> We cannot configure deny rules explicitly in security group
--> Security group is applicanle at resource level and manually we have to add security group to a resource
--> We can create a security group and use same SG for multiple resources



NACL
==========
NACL ( Network ACcess Control List )

--> Acts like a firewall for our subnets in VPC
--> It's applicable at subnet level
--> NACL is appplicable for all resources which are part of a subnet
--> in NACL we can configure allow and deny rules 
--> One NACL could be used for multiple subnets
--> One subnet can have only one NACL
--> NACL acts as first level of defense for incoming traffic and SG acts like first level of defense for outgoing traffic
