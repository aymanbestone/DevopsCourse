OSI Model ( Open Systems Interconnection )
=========

==> How data  travels from a client to a server in a network

The OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model explains how data travels from a client to a server in a network. It has 7 layers, each with a specific role:

Layer 1 – Physical Layer
Transfers raw bits (0s and 1s) over cables or wireless signals (e.g., Ethernet, Wi-Fi).

Layer 2 – Data Link Layer
Provides reliable data transfer between two devices on the same network using MAC addresses. Handles error detection and correction.

Layer 3 – Network Layer
Routes data between different networks using logical addressing (like IP addresses). Determines the best path to the destination.

Layer 4 – Transport Layer
Ensures complete and reliable data transfer using protocols like TCP (reliable) or UDP (fast but not reliable).

Layer 5 – Session Layer
Manages and maintains communication sessions between devices. Handles setup, use, and termination of connections.

Layer 6 – Presentation Layer
Translates data formats between the application and the network (e.g., encryption, compression, encoding like JPEG, MP4).

Layer 7 – Application Layer
Closest to the user. Provides network services to applications like web browsers, email clients, etc. (e.g., HTTP, FTP, DNS).




=============================================================================
Application Load Balancer (ALB)
------------------------------

Works at OSI Layer 7 
(Application Layer)

Best for HTTP/HTTPS traffic

Makes routing decisions based on URL, headers, host, etc.

Example: Routes /api/* to one target group and /admin/* to another.


Network Load Balancer (NLB)
-----------------------------

Works at OSI Layer 4 (Transport Layer)

Handles TCP, UDP, and TLS traffic with very high performance and low latency

Ideal for real-time applications, gaming, or VoIP.


Gateway Load Balancer (GWLB)
-------------------------------

Works at OSI Layer 3 (Network Layer)	

Used mainly for third-party appliances like firewalls, deep packet inspection, etc.

Routes traffic based on IP and protocol without modifying the packet.
