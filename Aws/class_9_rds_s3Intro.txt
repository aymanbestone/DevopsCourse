AWS S3 ( Simple Storage Service )

-> S3 is a storage service in AWS which supports unlimited storage where we can store any amount of data from anywhere

-> S3 supports Object based storage ( files )

-> We can upload or download objects ( file) at  any given point of time using S3

-> In S3, we create buckets to store the data
