Storage Classes in S3
======================
--> Storage classes are used to specify how frequently to access the objects from S3

we have diff types of storage classes 
Standard
Frequently accessed data (more than once a month) with milliseconds access
General purpose
≥ 3


Intelligent-Tiering
Data with changing or unknown access patterns
General purpose
≥ 3

Standard-IA
Infrequently accessed data (once a month) with milliseconds access
General purpose
≥ 3

One Zone-IA
Recreatable, infrequently accessed data (once a month) with milliseconds access
General purpose or directory
1

Glacier Instant Retrieval
Long-lived archive data accessed once a quarter with instant retrieval in milliseconds
General purpose
≥ 3

Glacier Flexible Retrieval (formerly Glacier)
Long-lived archive data accessed once a year with retrieval of minutes to hours
General purpose
≥ 3

Glacier Deep Archive
Long-lived archive data accessed less than once a year with retrieval of hours
General purpose
≥ 3

Reduced redundancy
Noncritical, frequently accessed data with milliseconds access (not recommended as S3 Standard is more cost effective)
General purpose
≥ 3

------------------------------------------------

Transfer acceleration
==========================
Use an accelerated endpoint for faster data transfers
( Used to speed up data transfer process in S3 bucket)

Object Lock
===========

==> Store objects using a write-once-read-many (WORM) model to help you prevent objects from being deleted or overwritten for a fixed amount of time or indefinitely.
 
==> Object Lock works only in versioned buckets.

===============================================================

IAM ( Identity and Access Management )
=========================================

Two ways access the aws cloud account
1-> Root Account --> Powerful account with all the access and no restriction
2 -> IAM account 

--> It is used to manage users, groups, policies and roles

--> IAM is a free service 

--> Root account owner can access everything in AWS without any restrictions 
    (It is highly recommended to enable high security by enabling Multifactor Authentication MFA for root user account)

As a part of a team or a project you will be getting IAM account credentials with specific access 


IAM Policies --> Permissions 

What actions are allowed or denied on which aws resources and under what condition

Resource-specific: Permissions are almost always tied to specific AWS resources (e.g., a particular S3 bucket, an EC2 instance, a DynamoDB table).

No inherent identity: A policy on its own does nothing. It's just a set of rules. It needs to be attached to an identity or a resource to take effect.
