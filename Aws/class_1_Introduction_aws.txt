Cloud Computing with AWS
==========================

AWS Services :

In AWS we have 200+ services 

-> Why Cloud and What is Cloud Computing
-> Cloud Providers
-> AWS Introduction and Services Overview
-> Regions & AZ's
-> EC2 ( Elastic Compute Cloud) -> To Create Virtual Machines ( Hourly )
-> EBS (Elastic Block Store + volumes + Snapshots) --> Hard Disc, SSD
-> Load Balancer : To distribute Load
-> Autoscaling : Adjusting the capacity by based on the demand
-> S3 : Unlimited Storage
-> RDS : Relational Database service
-> EFS : Shared File system ( Elastic file system
-> IAM : Identity & Access Management
-> VPC : Virtual Private Cloud ( Networking )
-> Cloud Formation : Infrastructure as a code ---> Terraform
-> AWS CLI : AWS Command Line Interface
-> Elastic Beanstalk : Platform as a service
-> AWS Lambdas : Serverless computing
-> EKS : K8S cluster ( Elastic Kubernetes Service )
-> Route 53: Domain mapping
-> Cloud Watch 
-> SNS : Simple notification Service
-> Billing Overview

=================================================================================

Infrastructure 
---------------
--> The resources required to run our project / company ( Machines , networks, storage, database, monitoring ......)

--> We can maintain infrastructure in 2 ways 
1) On-prem infrastructure
2) Cloud Infrastructure


On-prem infrastructure
======================

--> On-Prem infra --> Purchasing and maintaining all resources by our own
--> Challenges and limitations of On-prem infrastructure
    -> Lot of Cost
    -> Scalability
    -> Security Issue
    -> Availability
    -> Network issue

--> To Overcome the problems of on prem infra most of the companies prefer Cloud Infrastructure


Cloud Computing 
===================

--> Delivering IT resources over internet on-demand basis with "Pay AS You Go model" is referred as Cloud Computing.

   Advantages 
----------------
-> Pay as you go
-> Security
-> Backup 
-> Scalability
-> Availability

Cloud Service Models
====================
1) IAAS : Infrastructure as a service

2) PAAS : Platform as a service

3) SAAS : Software as a service

IAAS : Infrastructure as a service
----------------------------------
--> Provider will provide infrastructure 
    ex: Machines(servers), storage, network
--> We need to take care of platform and application

Your Responsibility: Operating systems, applications, data, runtime, middleware.

PAAS : Platform as a service
----------------------------
--> Provider will provider ready made platform to run our app ( Provider will take care of infrastructure and platform )
ex: AWS Elastic beanstalk

The provider handles the underlying infrastructure and the software environment (operating systems, middleware, databases, web servers). You just focus on your code.

Your Responsibility: Your application code, data, and configuration.


SAAS : Software as a service
-----------------------------
--> Application + Infrastructure + Platform all will be maintained by provider
--> Provider will give their application to run our business

ex: Zoom , Dropbox, Google Drive ........

AWS Cloud --> Amazon Webservices
=========

AWS Providing Cloud Services from 2006 

AWS Works on "Pay As You Go" model

AWS Global Infrastructure
The AWS Cloud spans 117 Availability Zones(AZ) within 37 Geographic Regions

It is recommended to use nearest region to create infrastructure


AWS (Amazon Web Services) is a comprehensive, broadly adopted, and secure cloud platform, offering over 200 fully featured services from data centers globally. It provides on-demand delivery of IT resources and applications via the internet with pay-as-you-go pricing.
