Lambda
=========
Run code without thinking about servers

AWS Lambda
==> lets you run code without thinking about servers.
==> You pay only for the compute time that you consume — there is no charge when your code is not running. With Lambda, you can run code for virtually any type of application or backend service, all with zero administration.

==> Suitable for short span works ex: Batch Process, Image processing , ML ..etc

==> Use one programming language

==> Lambda is designed for event driven architecture where functions are triggered by events from various sources....

Cloud Watch and SNS
========================

--> Amazon CloudWatch is a monitoring and oberrvebility service which allows users to collect metrics and monitor logs, set alarms and so on..

Cloud watch and SNS practical task
===================================

==> Create SNS Topic with Email Notification (Standard Create)

==> Configure Email Subscription in SNS Topic (Confirm Subscription recieved in email)

==> Select EC2 Instance -> Action -> Monitor and trouble Shoot -> Manager Cloud Watch Alarms -> Create cloud watch  Alarm
    
  Alaram Notification : Select SNS Topic which we have created
  Alaram Thresh Hold : Avg CPU >= 2%

==>  Connect to EC2 instance

==> Increase load on the EC2 instance using "stress" software

  $ sudo yum install stress -y
  $ sudo stress --cpu 8 -v --timeout 60s

==>  Execute stress command 3 to 4 times or any other commands to increate load on server...  

==> Observe the behaviour of Cloud Watch / Alaram / SNS  
    (We should get Email Notification)

When Alarm got triggered, its status will be changed to 'In Alarm'

==>  We can Monitor our Alarm history (how many times it got triggered)
