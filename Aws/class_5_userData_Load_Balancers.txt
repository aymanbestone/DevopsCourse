user-data in EC2 VM
====================

--> It is used to execute except while launching EC2 Instance ( VM )

--> User data will execute only once

--> Create an EC2 VM with following user data 

#! /bin/bash

sudo yum install httpd -y

cd /var/www/html
echo "<html><h1> Telusko Learning App - 1 </h1></html>" > index.html
service httpd start

--> After the VM is launched access the website using public ip in the web browser

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Load Balancer
=============

--> When we deploy our app into a single server then we might/may face the following issues/challenges

    -> One Server trying to handle all requests coming to app 
    -> Increased Burden on the server
    -> Server may slow down leading delayed responses to the clients
    -> Server can crash too
    -> Single Point of Failure

--> To Avoid the above issues, we shall deploy our app into multiple servers and implement the concept of load balancer

--> Load Balancer is used to distribute load to multiple servers in round robin technique

--> The following benefits could be noticed with Load balancer
   
    -> Our App will run on Multiple Servers
    -> Load will be distributed into multiple servers
    -> Burden will eventually reduced on servers
    -> Fast Performance 
    -> High Availability of our app 

-> In AWS there are 4 types of Load Balancers

   -> Application Load Balancer ( http & https )
   -> Network Load Balancer
   -> Gateway Load Balancer
   -> Classic Load Balancer

-----------------------------------------------------
Practical on Load Balancer
--------------------------

--> Create EC2 VM 1 with below following user data

#! /bin/bash

sudo yum install httpd -y

cd /var/www/html
echo "<html><h1> Telusko Learning App - 1 </h1></html>" > index.html
service httpd start

--> Create EC2 VM 2 

#! /bin/bash

sudo yum install httpd -y

cd /var/www/html
echo "<html><h1> Telusko Learning App - 2 </h1></html>" > index.html
service httpd start

--> Add these 2 webservers into one Target Group
( Follow live class instructions )

--> Create a Application Load Balancer with Target Group (ALB)
      Schm: Internet Facing   ( Follow live class recordings )


Make sure HTTO Protocol with 80 port no is enabled as ALB runs on same

--> Access Load Balancer DNS in browser ( You will notice the requests to our servers getting distributed in round robin technique )
