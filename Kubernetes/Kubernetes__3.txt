==> Create EKS Cluster using eksctl

$ eksctl create cluster --name telusko1-cluster1 --region ap-south-1 --node-type t2.medium  --zones ap-south-1a,ap-south-1b

 -> EKS cluster "telusko1-cluster1" in "ap-south-1" region is ready

kubectl command should work with "/home/ubuntu/.kube/config", try 'kubectl get nodes'

$ cat /home/ubuntu/.kube/config

$ kubectl get nodes

==> To delete cluster 

$ eksctl delete cluster --name telusko1-cluster1 --region ap-south-1

K8S Services :
=============

Service is sued to expose PODS

==> We have 3 types of services in k8s
    -> Cluster IP
    -> Node Port
    -> Load Balancer

-> Cluster IP
================
-> POD is a short lived Object

-> If POD is damaged/deleted/crashed then k8s will replace that with a new POD (Self Healing)

-> When POD is re created IP will change ( It is not recommended to access Pods using POD IP)

-> Cluster IP service is used to link all PODS in single IP

-> Cluster IP is a static IP to access pods

-> Using Cluster IP we can access pods only within the cluster

-> NodePort Service 
--------------------
--> NodePort service is used to expose our pods outside the cluster.

--> Using NodePort we can access our app with worker node Public IP address.

--> When we use Worker Node Public IP to access our pod then all requests will go to same worker node (Burden will be increased on the node)

--> To distribute load to multiple worker nodes we will use Load Balancer service

-> Load Balancer Service 
-------------------------

--> It is used to expose our pods outside cluster using AWS LoadBalancer

--> When we access load balancer url, requests will be distributed to all pods running in all worker nodes.
