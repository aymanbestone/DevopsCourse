Kubernetes (K8S)
=================

DevOps with AWS ==> Telusko

================================================================

==> It is free and open source s/w
==> Developed by Google and currently maintained by CNCF (Cloud native Computing Foundation)
==> GO Programming Language is used to Develop Kubernetes

==> Kubernetes is an Orchestration Platform
==> Used to Managed Containers (Create/stop/start/delete/scale-up/scale-down)
==> It provides framework for managing the complex task of deploying, scaling and operating applications in containers

Advantages 
===========
1) Self Healing : If any container get crashed or major issue then it will be replaced with new container

2) Auto Scaling : Based on demand, containers count will be increased or decreased

3) Load Balancing : Load will be distributed among all containers which are up and running

Docker vs K8S
================

Docker : Containerization platform(packaging our app code and dependencies as single unit for execution)

Kubernetes : Orchestration platform (Managing the containers)

Kubernetes Architecture
=========================

1) Control Plane/Node (Master Node)

  ==> API Server
  ==> Schedular
  ==> Controller Manager
  ==> ETCD

2) Worker Node

  ==> kubelet
  ==> kube proxy
  ==> POD
  ==> Container
  ==> Docker

==> To Deploy our app using k8s we need to communicate with Control Plane 

==> We usually use KUBECTL (CLI) to communicate with control plane

-> API Server will receive the request given by kubectl and it will store the request with pending status in etcd
   (Entry point for all commands. Exposes Kubernetes API (kubectl, REST))


-> etcd is an internal database of k8s cluster

-> Schedular will identify the pending requests in etcd and it will identify worker node to schedule the task

-> Schedular will identify worker node using kubelet

-> kubelet is a node agent which will maintain all worker node info

-> kube proxy will provide network for cluster communication

-> Controller Manager will verify all tasks are working fine as expected or not

-> Docker Engine would be present in worker node to run the docker containers

-> In K8S, Containers will be created inside POD 
(POD is smallest building block that we can create in k8s cluster)

-> Generally in k8s, everything is represented as POD only

===================================================================

POD :
======
POD is a smallest building block in the K8S cluster and application will be deployed as pod in k8s

We can create multiple pods for one application

To Create a POD we use YML file (Manifest YML) and POD manifest YML we will configure our Docker image

If POD is damaged/deleted/crashed then k8s will create a new pod (Self-Healing)

If an app is running in multiple pods, then k8s will distribute the load to all the running pos (Load Balancers)

PODS can be increased or decreased automatically based on load (Scalability)




K8S Cluster Setup
=================
1) Mini Kube --> Single Node Cluster --> Only for practice or to get started with k8s

2) Kubeadm Cluster --> Self Managed Cluster --> We are responsible for everything

3) Provider Managed Cluster --> Reader made Cluster --> Provider will take care of everything
        (AWS EKS, Azure AKS, GCP GKE etc ......)

Note : Provider Managed Cluster are paid (Chargeable)
