Autoscaling
===========
==> Process of increasing / decreasing infrastructure resources based on the demand (traffic, memory, CPU)

==> Types of Scaling

1.Horizontal Scaling
=> Adding more servers/instances/Pods ( 3 pods --> 6 pods )
Scale Out --> increasing servers/ pods
Scale In --> reduces resources( 6 pods --> 2 pods )

HPA(Horizontal Pod Autoscaler)

2.Vertical Scaling
=> Increases resources of same system ( instead of 2 CPU, give 4 CPUs, 4GB RAM --> 8GB)
Scale UP --> Increases capacity of same server
Scale Down --> Reducing resource of same system

Note : In Kubernetes, vertical scaling is less common bcz Pods are meant to be lightweight but you can do Vertical Pod Autoscaler(VPA)


Kubernetes Metric Server --> also called Heapster
=========================
It is used for monitoring the overall health and performance of k8s cluster, providing data needed for Kubernetes feature like HPA.

Note : Metrics Server will not be present by default in k8s cluster

HPA will interact with Metric Server to identify CPU/Memory utilization of POD

==> This metric server in k8s will collect info like cpu, ram etc for all pods and nodes in the cluster

# Install metrics-server
kubectl apply -f https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/metrics-server/releases/latest/download/high-availability-1.21+.yaml



# Try metrics
kubectl top nodes
kubectl top pods

Pending Metric server installation

===========================
Resource Quota
==============

==> Kubernetes cluster can be divided into namespaces 

==> The Pods in k8s will run with no limitation of Memory and CPU be default

==> We can give limit for Pod (Set limits to CPU, Memory, storage)
