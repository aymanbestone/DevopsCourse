shebang is shell scripting
---------------------------
Writing shebang is optional but highly recommended

It's first line of a shell script file the interpreter or shell to be used for executing
The default shell used is bash

Variables 
===============================

To store the data we use variables in scripting
There are 2 types of variables 
1) pre-defined variables /env variables
$ echo $SHELL
/bin/bash
$ echo $USER
ec2-user
$ echo $PATH
/home/ec2-user/.local/bin:/home/ec2-user/bin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/sbin

these are system variables which are defined by our system

2) user defined variables 
id = 4
name = rohan
city= Bengaluru

Variable are case sensitive 

There are no data types in shell scripting and we need not to speify the type of data when declaring or creating variables 


$ vi  variable-script.sh

#! /bin/bash
echo "Enter your Name"
read FULLNAME
echo "Enter City Name"
read CITY

echo "Your Name and city : $FULLNAME $CITY "


$ sh variable-script.sh
Enter your Name
Srikanth
Enter City Name
Chennai
Your Name and city : Srikanth Chennai

--------------------------
$ vi 02-var-script.sh

#! /bin/bash
echo "Enter Your City Name"
read CITY
echo " City is $CITY "
unset CITY    -----> To unset or remove value from variable
echo "City is $CITY "

$ sh 02-var-script.sh

Enter Your City Name
Pune
City is Pune
City is


--------------------------------------------------
Rules to work with variables 
============================
Variable name must not start with digits --> 1name ( invalid ) name1 ( valid)
It must not have any special character --> @ $ #

Note: It is highly recommended to use UPPERCASE for variables naming 

Operators
============
Operators are used to perform operations on variables/data

Arithmetic operations
------------------------

Addition : $((num1+ num2))

Subtraction : $((num1- num2))

Multiplication : $((num1*num2))

Division : $((num1/ num2))

Modulas : $((num1%num2))

$ vi operator-script.sh

#! /bin/bash

echo "Enter the first number to ADD"

read FNUM

echo "Enter the second number "

read SNUM

echo "Result of Addition : $((FNUM+SNUM))"

-----------
$ sh operator-script.sh
Enter the first number to ADD
44
Enter the second number
