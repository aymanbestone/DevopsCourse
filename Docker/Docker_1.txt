Application Architecture 
=========================
1) User Interface --> Frontend --> End user will use app through ui
   (HTML CSS JS Angular, Reactjs ....)


2) Backend --> Business logic
   (Java, Python, .Net, .....)

3) Database : Store Data --> Storage
   (MySQL, SQLServer, MongoDb, Oracle.....)

Application Code --> Java, MySQL, Angular 16 --> Tomcat

If we want to run our app code, then we must setup all required dependencies(Softwares which are required to run our application) in the machine
Example : Java + MySQL + Angular + Tomcat Server

Application Environments
=======================
DEV, SIT, UAT, PILOT, PROD

Dev Env used by Developers for code integration testing

SIT env used by Testers for System Integration testing

UAT env used by client team for acceptance testing (Go or No Go)

Pilot env is used for pre-production testing

Prod env used for live deployment(end users can access our app)


As a devOps engineer we are responsible to setup infrastructure to run our app  
--> We need to setup dependencies in all the environments(DEV< SIT< UAT< PILOT< PROD) to run our application


In this case there is a high chance of doing mistakes in dependencies installation process (Version compatability issues can occur)


Solution for the above problem could be solved in 2 ways
==> Virtualization
==> Containerization
( Refer board work attached with diagrams and Live class recordings )

==> To Simplify application execution in any machine we can go with Docker


Docker 
========
==> Docker is a free and open source software/tool

==> Used for Containerization  --> We can run our application in any machine

==> Container ==> application code + application dependencies
(Docker will take care of dependencies installation required for our app)
==> It will make our app portable using Docker
