Pot Mapping -p
---------------
docker rum -d -p <hostportno>:<containerportno> nameofimage

$ docker run -d -p 8484:8080 hacker123shiva/springbt-in-docker:latest

By default, containers are isolated and run in their own network namespace.

This means services inside a container (say an app running on port 8080) are not accessible from your host machine or external clients.

To expose the service, you must map a container’s internal port to a port on the host machine.

That’s what -p does in Docker.

-p is used for port mapping between host and container.


Dockerfile
============
Dockerfile contains instructions to build docker image

(Used to specify where is application code and what dependencies are required + pre built images --> Blue print of docker image)


==> The following keywords plays important role creating docker file

FROM
MAINTAINER
RUN
CMD
COPY
ADD
WORKDIR
EXPOSE
ENTRYPOINT
USER

FROM
-----
It is used to specify base image for our application

FROM python:3.3
FROM OpenJDK:17
FROM tomcat:9.0
FROM bode:19.5
FROM mysql:8.5

MAINTAINER
----------

It is used to specify author of Dockerfile

MAINTAINER Satyasheel <satyatelusko@telusko.com>


RUN
----

RUN keyword is used to specify instructions to execute at the time of image creation

ex: RUN 'git clone<url>
 RUN 'mvn clean package'

If required we can write multiple RUN instructions in single Docker file and all those instructions will be processed in order


CMD
----
CMD keyword is sued to specify instructions to execute at the time of docker container creation

ex: CMD 'java -jar app.jar'
    CMD 'app.py'

One Docker file can have multiple CMD instructions however docker will proceed only last CMD instruction



example:

$ vi Dockerfile

FROM ubuntu

MAINTAINER Ramu ramu@telusko.com

RUN echo 'hello from telusko'

RUN echo 'hello from haider'

RUN echo 'hello from founder office harsh rawal'

CMD echo 'hi from cmd1'

CMD echo 'hi from cmd2'

$ docker build -t alien .    ==> alien is name of image and . is present directory

$ docker images

$ docker run alien
